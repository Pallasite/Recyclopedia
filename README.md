# Recyclopedia - Saving the Worldâ„¢
*a Software Engineering CS506 - Group Project*

## Description
Recyclopedia is to be a platform for providing easy access to detailed information concerning whether or not certain items can be Recycled at specific locations. 

## Getting Started


The Ionic front end can be viewed by installing Node.js LTS, once installed run commands
    $sudo npm install -g cordova
$sudo    npm install -g ionic
Then, navigate to the git project directory and run
    $ionic serve
This should open a browser window with our application in it. It will not be connected to the database, so any search queries will fail. However, navigation through the application and buttons should work. The integrated map will only display if the user allows location access in the browser.

If errors occur due to missing scripts try running
    $ npm i @ionic/app-scripts
