## Description
Recyclopedia is to be a platform for providing easy access to detailed information concerning whether or not certain items can be Recycled at specific locations. 

## Running Instructions 
### Frontend
To run the Ionic front end, Node.js must be installed. Then, once Node is installed (and assuming npm was installed with it), install the Ionic framework and install Cordova:

```
npm install -g ionic
npm install -g cordova
```

Once ionic is installed, change working directories into the repository root directory, and run

```
ionic serve
```
To start a development server. A browser window will be launched, but unless a database is running queries will not be functional. Howerver, site navigation and various buttons will be working.

If any errors occur the following may fix those errors:
```
npm i @ionic/app-scripts
```

### Backend
